Github code link: https://github.com/mgupta325/ML_assignment2.git

To run the code :

1.Go to the above link,save the python files, dataset in the same directory and then we can run it on any python 3 intrepeter/virtual environment.

2.The following python libraries must be installed: scikit learn(sklearn),numpy,pandas,warnings,time,mlrose.

3.Open the required python file and run it.

Dataset- tic-tac-toe.data

Python files: 4p.py- randomized optimization experiments on 4 peaks problem
